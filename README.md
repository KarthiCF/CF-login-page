# CF-login-page
sample website of Cyber Factory
I have made this website during my internship. Since the internship is focussed on Javascript, The website would not be formal with classic rules.

Website link: https://cyberfactory.000webhostapp.com/

This website contains :

1. Login page: https://cyberfactory.000webhostapp.com/
    This email id field checks for the exixting email ids in the local storage. If found it will accept the login. But here the password might be any. Because, the passwords are not stored in local storage, it was skipped.
2. Signup page: https://cyberfactory.000webhostapp.com/signup.html
    If there is no login details, a new account must be created here. The fields in this page are created with Bootstrap empty field indication. Before signing in, the user must accept the terms and conditions. There will be seperate links for the terms and conditions and privacy policy. If the create account button is clicked, the data is stored in local storage and also in the CRUD table of this website's subdomain.
3. Data table: https://cyberfactory.000webhostapp.com/home.html
    The sign in details are stored here and the user can update, delete or edit their informations.
4. Todo page : https://cyberfactory.000webhostapp.com/todo.html
5. Sticky notes page : https://cyberfactory.000webhostapp.com/stickyNotes.html
